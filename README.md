The **ultimate** way to ensure your package delivery business is *effective* and on time!
We will *ensure* your products get delivered to your clients safely & in a timely manner.
**Accurate** GPS coordinates will allow your drivers to deliver the nearest item to the nearest home, *improving* delivery efficiency and timing.
Drivers will have a minimum number of set deliveries a day that need to be followed, and a maximum number of packages they can deliver. 
I chose this project as I enjoy ordering stuff online, but sometimes my packages are delivered late,
so I decided to tackle this problem by helping drivers deliver effectively and in a timely manner! 

Why are we of benefit?
- Increased customer satisfaction
- Improve delivery efficiency & timing
- Happier driver employees!
